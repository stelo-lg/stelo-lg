- 👋 Hi, I’m @stelo-lg, you can call me just stelo! 
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, data science, machine learning, chemistry and sustainability. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying computer science, trying to learn as much about data science and machine learning as possible and are about to finish my PhD in sustainable chemistry.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some chemoinformatic projects to share my knowledge in python/data science and chemistry or any project, which combines environmental sciences and programming/data science.
